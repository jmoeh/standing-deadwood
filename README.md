## Global, Multi-Scale Standing Deadwood Segmentation In Centimeter-Scale Aerial Images

This repository contains code for the paper "Global, Multi-Scale Standing Deadwood Segmentation In Centimeter-Scale Aerial Images". (TODO add doi)


- Preprocessig: see `preprocessing_notebooks`
- Training:`launch_training_phaestos.sh`: This launches the `train.py` with the accelerate library and with the config `config_mixvision_large_oversample_newdata_full_training.json`
- Figures: see `plotting_notebooks`


This repository does not contain code for the inference. For that checkout: https://github.com/cmosig/deadtreesmodels
